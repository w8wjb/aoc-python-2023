# Advent of Code 2023

### Where is everything?

* Solutions are name day#_#.py, where the first number is the day (1-25) and the second number is the star (1-2)
* Sample inputs are files in `samples`
* Puzzle inputs are files in `input`

### Running puzzle solutions

By default, the scripts take one argument which should be the path to the puzzle input. This is so that it can be run first on the sample input and then on the puzzle input.

Example:
```shell
./day1_1.py samples/day1.txt

./day1_1.py input/day1.txt
```
